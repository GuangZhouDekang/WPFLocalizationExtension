### Installation

The library itself can be obtained by two ways: 

* If you just want to use it without the need of compiling it, use the NuGet package manager of your VisualStudio or download it directly from our [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WpfLocalizeExtension). 
* If you are interested in the project details, feel free to get your own copy of the source code from GitHub.

By using NuGet you just have to choose the projects where you want to use the extension - the rest is done automatically by NuGet as usual. 

### Dependencies

Starting with version 1.0.3, the project depends on the project [XAML Markup Extensions](https://github.com/XAMLMarkupExtensions/XAMLMarkupExtensions). NuGet will automatically ask you to download this package along with the LocalizationExtension.
